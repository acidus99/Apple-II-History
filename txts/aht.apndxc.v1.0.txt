     This table shows in an abbreviated format the approximate dates of product release and product discontinuation during the Apple II era.  Generally, the left half of the table deals with the 6502/65816 Apple II series of computers (and the closely related Apple III), and the right half deals with the 680x0 Lisa and Macintosh series.  The Mac data is more sketchy than I would like, but there have been so many new types of Macs released in the past few years that it is hard to keep track of when the new ones came out, and even more difficult to find when the old ones were discontinued.
     Each year is divided up into six parts; so each horizontal tick refers to two months (Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr, etc).  For a product introduction, the line where the first part of the name appears (if it takes up more than one line) represents the date it was released.  If the discontinuation date is known, the "===" mark represents that date; if it is not known, the vertical line will terminate in a "???".
     In the case of several product lines, their revisions are designated in the same vertical line since they were modifications of the existing machines, but not entirely new products.
     There is no implied significance in the vertical positioning of products.  Ideally, I would have liked to display each different product on a separate vertical line, but did not have enough space to fit all of that information horizontally in this format.
