# The Apple II Timeline

The Apple II Timeline gives an overview of many of the events mentioned in the Apple II History, as well as some others that are not discussed. The dates given for the various entries found here are as accurate as I can make them, based on the sources cited in the footnotes that follow. In some cases I could come no closer to the correct date than the year in which it happened. If there is no reference number, it is because I cannot find the source of the information, but know that it is reasonably accurate.

In regard to the various versions of Apple II disk operating systems: For DOS I chose to use the date found on the HELLO program on System Masters; I chose for ProDOS 8 to use the date displayed when it starts up; and for GS/OS the dates it was first announced in Open-Apple or A2-Central. The dates they were completed and the dates they were available are sometimes several months apart.

One other thing that may make some of these dates slightly inaccurate is the difference between a product "announcement", "introduction", and "release". Something may be "introduced" on one date, but not available or "released" until a later date (the IBM PCjr comes to mind). If anyone cares to correct me on any of these points, please feel free to contact me with your information source, and I will be glad to make the change.

Ladies and gentlemen, the History of the Apple II Time-Sweep. Every number one event, in order, beginning in June, 1969. Sit back, for the Greatest (Computer) Hits of All Time!

## 1969

* Intel designs the 4004 microprocessor. The name is derived from the approximate number of transistors that it replaced, and indirectly was a measure of its complexity, as it handled 4 bits of data at a time.[86]

* Micro Instrumentations Telemetry Systems (MITS), started by Ed Roberts, begins to manufacture and sell calculators.[91]

### June

* The Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency funds the creation of ARPANet, to make it possible for their various research facilities to communicate with each other from around the country. It begins with only three host computers, and eventually evolves to become what is now known as the Internet.

### December

* ARPA's Network Working Group designs "telnet", a protocol that allowed users to logon remotely to any computer on the ARPANet network.[141]

## 1971

* Steve Wozniak and his high-school friend Bill Hernandez build a computer out of parts rejected by local companies, ending up with a box with lights and switches (similar to the Altair 8800 that would not appear until 1975). They called it the "Cream Soda Computer", since that was their drink of choice while they were building it. The first demonstration of the computer burned up the power supply.[123]

* Wozniak and Steve Jobs start their first joint business venture, selling "blue boxes" (capable of making "free" long distance phone calls) at the Berkeley dorms.[1]

* Intel begins to advertise the 4004 processor, beginning with the fall 1971 issue of Electronic News. Regis McKenna, whose agency would later be hired to advertise the Apple II computer, designs the promotion.[87]

* Intel begins work on an 8-bit processor, the 8008.[86]
 
## 1972

* Paul Allen convinces Bill Gates to join him in writing a BASIC interpreter for this new 8008 processor. They design a machine to use it, and form their first business venture, a company called Traf-O-Data, to process traffic information using their small computer.[88]

* Intel contracts with Gary Kildall, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Pacific Grove, California, to write a computer language that would run on the Intel 4004 processor. Kildall choses to create PL/M, a version of a mainframe computer language called PL/I. In the process of writing this language, Kildall develops a simple operating system as a background for the interpreter and to control a paper-tape reader and writer. This operating system was the basis for what he later called CP/M ("Control Program/Monitor").[89]

* The U.S. government's official name for ARPA ("Advanced Research Projects Agency") is changed to DARPA ("Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency"), to stress the defense role the organization had played from its very inception. The name "ARPANet" is not changed, however.[144]

### November

* Intel introduces the 8008 microprocessor, which runs at a speed of 200 kHz (or 0.2 MHz), and sells for $360.[88]

### October

* First public demonstration of ARPANet at the International Conference on Computer Communication, held in Washington, DC.[142]

## 1973

* Steve Wozniak takes a summer job and joins Bill Hernandez at Hewlett-Packard in their calculator division.[124]

* Wozniak starts up "Dial-A-Joke" from his apartment, telling Polish jokes in a thick accent. This phone line becomes one of the most frequently called numbers in the San Francisco Bay area.[124]

* Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) develops the "Alto", a breakthrough computer which used a pointing device called a "mouse", a bit-mapped graphic screen, and icons to represent documents. Also, it had a 2.5 megabyte removable disk cartridge and the first implementation of Ethernet. It cost $15,000 just to build it, and only 1,200 were ever produced. This computer and the Xerox Star were the inspirations within a decade for the Lisa and the Macintosh.[106]

* Kildall's CP/M is modified to work with the Intel 8008 microprocessor, and to interface with a disk drive. It now stands for "Control Program for Microcomputers".[89]

### May

* The Micral computer is released in France. It is the first computer built around a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. Designed by Fran√ßois Gernelle, and sold by the French company R2E for $1,750, fully assembled, it did not have any impact in the U.S.[105]

### September

* Radio Electronics magazine prints a construction article called "TV Typewriter" by Don Lancaster. This project allowed users to create a video terminal that worked with a standard television, and would allow them to connect to a mainframe computer -- if they had one available.[90] It could display 16 lines of 32 uppercase characters.[93]

## 1974

* Motorola introduces the 6800 microprocessor.

### March

* Scelbi-8H microcomputer introduced.[2]

* Micro-Soft's Altair BASIC is announced. It is shipped on paper tape.[8] MITS makes it available in two forms: for $500 when purchased by itself, or $75 when purchased with an Altair, a cassette interface, or 8K of MITS memory. The entire Altair 8800 cost only $400![95]

### July

* Altair BASIC is finally available for sale, in 4K and 8K versions. It is called "version 2.0", even though it is the first official BASIC that shipped.[96]

* Micro-Soft contracts with MITS for software development.[96]

* The government entity called the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), which in the 1960's was uninterested in the concept of a packet-sending distributed network, agrees to take over control of ARPANET from DARPA.[143]

* First meeting of the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyist Exchange (CACHE) at at Northwestern University.[151]

### September

* Byte begins publication.[7]

* MOS Technology introduces the 6501 and 6502 microprocessors at Wescon, the annual West Coast electronics show. These were created by the group of engineers who had left Motorola and joined MOS Technology in 1974.[119]

### November

* MITS announces the Altair 680b, a 6800-based cousin to the Altair 8800. It was not a big success for the company.[110]

### December

* The IMSAI 8080 released, the first major competitor to the Altair 8800. It used larger, flat switches for front-panel data input than did the Altair 8800, which made it easier on fingers than the tiny switches on the Altair. With 4K RAM in the base unit, it was sold as a kit for $439, or assembled for $621 (the same price as the Altair).[100]

* Paul Terrell, a salesman who was a member of the Homebrew Computer Club, opens the Byte Shop in Mountain View, California, and begins selling the Altair 8800.[121]

* Zilog's Z-80 microprocessor, running at 2.5 MHz, is released.[101]

* Microsoft begins working on versions of its BASIC for microprocessors other than the Intel 8080. Marc McDonald, Microsoft's first employee, writes a 6502 BASIC after modifying a Motorola 6800 simulator to work with the 6502 (which was similar). However, there were as yet no customers for a 6502 BASIC.[102]

* Processor Technology introduces the Sol, an Altair-compatable 8080 computer.[112]

### August

* PC'76, a microcomputer conference, is held in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak attend and demonstrate the Apple-1 and its new cassette interface. Wozniak completes his Apple BASIC interpreter (the precursor of Integer BASIC) in the hotel room the night prior to the conference, using the hotel TV as a monitor. It was the only 6502-based computer at the show, and because of its small size, full BASIC language, and fast cassette interface it generates a lot of interest, but unfortunately no orders for Apple.[103]

* Wozniak completes prototype of the Apple II. Chris Espinosa begins working on games and demonstration software for it.[11]

### October

* TI-99/4 computer by Texas Instruments is introduced ($1150), including a 16-bit TMS9900 processor, a color monitor, and a poorly designed keyboard. It was slow, and the company kept a tight reign on peripheral and software cartridge support, which made it difficult for third parties to support it.[7]

* Hayes Microcomputer Products begins selling the Micromodem 100 for S-100 bus computers, one of the first modems that had a direct connect line for the phone rather than sending and receiving the tones through the handset.[7]

In making their defense, Franklin had freely admitted they did copy the Apple II ROM, DOS, and several other pieces of software in the creation of its clone computers, and argued that computer code was not covered by copyright law (since it did not exist in a printed form that was readable without the aid of a computer), and therefore could be legally copied. This ruling in favor of Apple set the legal basis for declaring computer software as covered by copyright law.[131], [132]
