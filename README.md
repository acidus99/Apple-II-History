# Apple II History (Markdown Export)

Markdown versions of Steven Weyhrich's Apple II History Project text files with updated, properly licensed images.

## Why this project exists

I am a big fan of Steven Weyhrich's history of the Apple II, written in the 1990's over *23* different text files! Over the years, Steven edited the files, added some content, ported them to HTML, added some low quality images. These versions are scattered around, in various states for completeness, and slowly succumbing bit rot.

The versions that do exist have many issues:
* Originally the files were just text, with minimal formatting, and ASCII art which doesn't render properly due to charsets.
* Many versions of the files have hard newlines to keep lines below 40 characters or 80 characters
* Weird and inconsistent indenting, spacing.
* Images were added later, resulting in footnotes that are out of order
* Some images don't have footnotes
* Images are of low quality/low resolution typical of late 1990's
* Images come from unknown sources, with unknown usage rights 
* Not properly formatted metadata

I wanted to clean this content up and make it available to [Gemini Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)). Luckily [an early 2000's web version](https://www.duxburysystems.org/downloads/library/texas/apple/history/history/ah01.html) is licensed under a Creative Commons License.

## What I've done:

* Converting content to Markdown
* Adding YAML FrontMatter metadata
* Fixing typos and errors
* Replaced images with higher resolution images from properly licensed sources (Wikimedia Commons, Internet Archive, etc.)
